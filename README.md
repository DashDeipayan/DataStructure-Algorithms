# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS(By Deipayan Dash)

This is my regular update of practice of Data Structures and algorithms.<br/>I have primarily used **JAVA** and it's _Collections Frameworks_ as my preferred language and tools to master.<br/>
The letter 'I' denotes 'incomplete' <br/>
and <br/>
'N' denotes 'Not started yet'<br/>
This Repository is a continuously updating and improving repository so feel free to browse through.

## Various Data Structures:-

- Arrays(I)
- Strings(I)
- Lists(I)
  - ArrayLists
  - LinkedList
  - (Vectors)(Not interest TBH ðŸ˜“)
  - (Stacks)
- Queue(N)
  - PriorityQueue
- Set(N)
  - HashSet
  - LinkedHashSet
- Heaps(I)
- Trees(I)
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Segment Tree
  - (Fenwick Tree)
- Graphs(I)
